As the character moves along its path, it will hit grounds and obstacles before sliding or stepping on them. Knowing what
collider was hit on this path, and where the hit took place, can be valuable to apply various logic (custom forces,
sound effects, etc.) This is why a set of character collision events are collected during the calculation of its
trajectory.

:::info
The character collision events are given in chronological order. For example, if, during the resolution of the character
motion, the character hits an obstacle A, then slides against it, and then hits another obstacle B. The collision
with A will be reported first, and the collision with B will be reported second.

```rust
let character_controller = KinematicCharacterController::default();
// Use a closure to handle or collect the collisions while
// the character is being moved.
character_controller.move_shape(
    dt,
    bodies,
    colliders,
    queries,
    character_shape,
    character_pos,
    desired_translation,
    filter,
    |collision| { /* Handle or collect the collision in this closure. */ }
)

/* Read the character controller collisions stored in the character controller’s output. */
fn modify_character_controller_slopes(mut character_controller_outputs: Query<&mut KinematicCharacterControllerOutput>) {
    for mut output in outputs.iter_mut() {
        for collision in &output.collisions {
            // Do something with that collision information.
        }
    }
}
```

```js
let characterController = world.createCharacterController(0.01);
characterController.computeColliderMovement(collider, desiredMovementVector);

// After the collider movement calculation is done, we can read the
// collision events.
for (let i = 0; i < characterController.numComputedCollisions(); i++) {
    let collision = characterController.computedCollision(i);
    // Do something with that collision information.
}

Unless dynamic bodies are filtered-out by the character controller’s filters, they may be hit during the resolution
of the character movement. If that happens, these dynamic bodies will generally not react to (i.e. not be pushed by) the
character because the character controller’s offset prevents actual contacts from happening.

In these situations forces need to be applied manually to there rigid-bodies. The character controller can apply these
forces for you if needed:

<rapier>

```rust
let character_controller = KinematicCharacterController::default();

// First, collect all the collisions.
let mut collisions = vec![];
character_controller.move_shape(
    dt,
    &bodies,
    &colliders,
    &queries,
    character_shape,
    character_pos,
    desired_translation,
    filter,
    |collision| { collisions.push(collision) }
);

// Then, let the character controller solve (and apply) the collision impulses
// to the dynamic rigid-bodies hit along its path.
character_controller.solve_character_collision_impulses(
    dt,
    &mut bodies,
    &colliders,
    &queries,
    character_shape,
    character_mass,
    &collisions,
    filter,
);
```
