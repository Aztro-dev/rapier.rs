When a dynamic rigid-body doesn't move (or moves very slowly) during a few seconds, it will be marked as **sleeping**
by the physics pipeline. Rigid-bodies marked as sleeping are no longer simulated by
the physics engine until they are woken up. That way the physics engine doesn't waste any computational resources
simulating objects that don't actually move. They are woken up automatically whenever another non-sleeping rigid-body
starts interacting with them (either with a joint, or with one of its attached colliders generating contacts).

<bevy>

When using the `bevy_rapier` plugin, rigid-bodies are also automatically woken up whenever one of the
components of the rigid-body is modified (to apply forces, change its position, etc.) They will **not** be awaken
automatically when changing the gravity though. So you may sometimes want to wake a rigid-body manually by setting
the component field `Sleeping::sleeping` to `true`.

However, a sleeping rigid-body won't respond to any user action. This is why it is possible to wake-up the rigid-body
manually with `RigidBody::wake_up`. Some rigid-body methods take an additional `wake_up` boolean argument that, if
true, ensures that the rigid-body wakes up before the action takes place. For example:
- `RigidBody::add_force(force, true)` will wake-up the rigid-body before adding the force.
- `ImpulseJointSet::remove(..., true)` will wake-up the two rigid-bodies attached by the removed joints.
- `ColliderSet::remove(..., true)` will wake-up the rigid-body the removed collider is attached to.

Unless you want to achieve special effects, it is recommended to always set the `wake_up` argument to `true`.
One example of case where setting the argument of `wake_up` to `false` makes sense is to simulate a custom
constant gravity with `RigidBody::add_force(force, false)`. This will result in the force being added
to the rigid-body, but will allow the rigid-body to fall asleep if it reaches a dynamic equilibrium.

However, a sleeping rigid-body won't respond to any user action. This is why it is possible to wake-up the rigid-body
manually with `RigidBody.wakeUp()`. Some rigid-body methods take an additional `wakeUp` boolean argument that, if
true, ensures that the rigid-body wakes up before the action takes place. For example:
- `RigidBody.addForce(force, true)` will wake-up the rigid-body before adding the force.
- `World.removeJoint(joint, true)` will wake-up the two rigid-bodies attached by the removed joints.
- `World.removeCollider(collider, true)` will wake-up the rigid-body the removed collider is attached to.

Unless you want to achieve special effects, it is recommended to always set the `wakeUp` argument to `true`.
One example of case where setting the argument of `wakeUp` to `false` makes sense is to simulate a custom
constant gravity with `RigidBody.applyForce(force, false)`. This will result in the force being applied
to the rigid-body, but will allow the rigid-body to fall asleep if it reaches a dynamic equilibrium.
