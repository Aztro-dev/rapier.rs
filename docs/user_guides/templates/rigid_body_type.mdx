There are three types of rigid-bodies, identified by the <rapier>`RigidBodyType` enumeration</rapier><bevy>`RigidBodyTypeComponent` component</bevy><js>`RigidBodyType` enumeration</js>:

* **<notjs>`RigidBodyType::Dynamic`</notjs><js>`RigidBodyType.Dynamic`</js>:** Indicates that the body is affected by
  external forces and contacts.
* **<notjs>`RigidBodyType::Static`</notjs><js>`RigidBodyType.Static`</js>:** Indicates the body cannot move. It acts as
  if it has an infinite mass and will not be affected by any force. It will continue to collide with dynamic bodies but
  not with static nor with kinematic bodies. This is typically used for the ground or for temporarily freezing a body.
* **<notjs>`RigidBodyType::KinematicPositionBased`</notjs><js>`RigidBodyType.KinematicPositionBased`</js>:** Indicates
  that the body position must not be altered by the physics engine. The user is free to set its next position and the
  body velocity will be deduced at each update accordingly to ensure a realistic behavior of dynamic bodies in contact
  with it. This is typically used for moving **platforms**, **elevators**, etc.
* **<notjs>`RigidBodyType::KinematicVelocityBased`</notjs><js>`RigidBodyType.KinematicVelocityBased`</js>:** Indicates
  that the body velocity must not be altered by the physics engine. The user is free to set its velocity and the next
  body position will be deduced at each update accordingly to ensure a realistic behavior of dynamic bodies in contact
  with it. This is typically used for moving **platforms**, **elevators**, etc.

Both position-based and velocity-based kinematic bodies are mostly the same. Choosing between both is mostly a matter of
preference between position-based control and velocity-based control.
