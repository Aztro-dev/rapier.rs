Scene queries are geometric queries that take all the colliders of the physics world into account. These queries are
available through the [QueryPipeline](simulation_structures#the-query-pipeline).

<rapier>

Keep in mind that scene queries will only work as expected if no collider moved since the last call to `QueryPipeline::update`:

```rust
// Update the query pipeline to take the latest collider positions into account.
query_pipeline.update(&island_manager, &rigid_body_set, &collider_set);
// Scene queries can now be executed accurately.
```

:::note
Right now, the query pipeline takes the `IslandManager` and `RigidBodySet` as arguments. These two arguments
may look superfluous, especially if the colliders are not attached to rigid-bodies. A new update method that takes
a `ColliderSet` as its only argument will be added in the future.
