[**Bevy**](https://bevyengine.org) is an efficient, simple-to-use, and fast-to-compile data-driven game engine written
in Rust. It is based on the ECS (Entity-Component-System) paradigm and allows the definition of _plugins_, i.e., sets
of components, systems, and resources that share a common objective.

**Bevy** does not provide any built-in physics solution currently. That's why we created the
[**bevy_rapier2d**](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_rapier2d) and [**bevy_rapier3d**](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_rapier3d)
crates which integrate **Rapier** to **Bevy** using their plugin system. To use them, the first step is to add a dependency
to your `Cargo.toml`:

<Tabs
  groupId="dim"
  defaultValue="2D"
  values={[
    {label: 'Example 2D', value: '2D'},
    {label: 'Example 3D', value: '3D'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="2D">

```toml
[dependencies]
# TODO: Replace the * by the latest version numbers.
bevy_rapier2d = *
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3D">

```toml
[dependencies]
# TODO: Replace the * by the latest version numbers.
bevy_rapier3d = *
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that **bevy_rapier2d/bevy_rapier3d** re-exports the **nalgebra** and **rapier2d/rapier3d** crates it depends on. So you don't
need to depend on them explicitly. The **nalgebra** is re-exported as **na** and **rapier2d/rapier3d** is re-exported as **rapier**.

If you need to enable some Rapier features like SIMD, parallelism, serialization, or determinism, you can enable them on
**bevy_rapier** directly.


<Tabs
  groupId="dim"
  defaultValue="2D"
  values={[
    {label: 'Example 2D', value: '2D'},
    {label: 'Example 3D', value: '3D'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="2D">

```toml
[dependencies]
# TODO: Replace the * by the latest version numbers.
# Enable the `simd-stable` and `parallel` features of Rapier.
bevy_rapier2d = { version = "*", features = [ "simd-stable", "parallel" ] }
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3D">

```toml
[dependencies]
# TODO: Replace the * by the latest version numbers.
# Enable the `simd-stable` and `parallel` features of Rapier.
bevy_rapier3d = { version = "*", features = [ "simd-stable", "parallel" ] }
```
