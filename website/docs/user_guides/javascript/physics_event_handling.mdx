During the course of a physics simulation, colliders will collides, and sensors will be activated. These events can
be retrieved in order to apply custom game logics. There are currently two types of events:
- Contact events triggered when two colliders start or stop having contact points.
- Proximity events triggered when one sensor collider and another collider start of step touching.

In order to listen to these physics events, we need to:
1. Create and `EventQueue` which is responsible for collecting events occurring during one timestep.
2. Call `world.stepWithEvents(eventQueue)` instead of `world.step()` to advance the simulation.
3. Iterate through the events using `eventQueue.drainContactEvents` and `eventsQueue.drainProximityEvents`.

The parameter of the `EventQueue` constructor indicates whether or not the queue should be automatically cleared at
the beginning of each `stepWithEvents` call. Setting this to `false` will allow us to handle events that were generated
by previous timesteps. However, this may cause a memory overflow if the queue is never cleared or drained. If it is
set to `true`, then we need to handle the all physics events in-between each calls to `stepWithEvents`; all unhandled
events that occurred before the last call to `stepWithEvents` will be lost.

Handling the events is achieved by calling the corresponding drain function. This function will clear the event queue
and pass all its items to a JS closure:
- The `eventQueue.drainContactEvents` drains all the contact events. The input closure is expected to take three arguments:
two integers and one boolean. The twe integers are the handles of the colliders involved in the contact. We can retrieve
the actual collider reference form its integer handle using `world.getCollider(handle)`. The boolean indicates whether the
two colliders are starting to be in contact (true) or no longer have any contact point (false).
- The `eventQueue.drainProximityEvents` drain all the proximity events. The input closure is expected to take four arguments,
two integers and two integer enumerations of type `RAPIER.Proximity`. The two integers are the handles of the colliders
involved in the proximity. Because this is a proximity event and not a contact, one of these colliders (or both) will be a sensor.
The first proximity enum represents the previous known proximity state, and the the second proximity enum represents the
new proximity state. For example if `prevProximity == RAPIER.Proximity.Disjoint` and `newProximity == RAPIER.Proximity.Intersecting`
then the two colliders were disjoint during the last timestep and are now intersecting.
