:::info
This documentation is about the **Rust** version of Rapier. It may not apply to
the bindings for other languages. In particular, the JavaScript binding are quite
different from the **Rust** API so it feels more idiomatic.

## What is Rapier?
Rapier is a set of 2D and 3D physics engine written using the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
It targets applications requiring real-time physics like video games, animation, and robotics. It is designed to be fast,
stable, and optionally cross-platform deterministic. Rapier features include:
- Rigid-body collisions and forces.
- Joint constraints.
- Contact events and sensors.
- Snapshotting.
- Optional cross-platform determinism.
- JavaScript bindings.
- And moreâ€¦

Rapier is free and open-source, released under the Apache 2.0 license. It is developed by the [Dimforge](https://dimforge.com)
open-source company.


## Setting up Rapier with Cargo
**rapier** relies on the official Rust package manager
[Cargo](https://crates.io) for dependency resolution and compilation. Therefore,
making **rapier** ready to be used by your project is simply a matter of
adding a new dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file. You can either use the **rapier2d**
crate for 2D physics simulation or the **rapier3d** crate for 3D physics simulation. You will also
need the **nalgebra** crate as well because it defines algebraic entities
(vectors, points, transformation matrices) used by most types of **rapier**.

Until **rapier** reaches 1.0, it is strongly recommended to always use its
latest version, though you may encounter breaking changes from time to time.

To get the best of **rapier** multiple features can be enabled optionally:
- `simd-stable`: enables explicit SIMD optimizations using the [`wide` crate](https://crates.io/crates/wide).
Has limited cross-platform support but can be used with a stable version of the Rust compiler.
- `simd-nightly`: enables explicit SIMD optimizations using the [`packed_simd` crate](https://crates.io/crates/packed_simd).
Has a great cross-platform support but requires a nightly version of the Rust compiler.
- `parallel`: enable parallelism of the physics pipeline with the [`rayon` crate](https://crates.io/crates/rayon).
- `serde-serialize`: enable serialization of the physics components with [`serde`](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde).
- `enhanced-determinism`: enables cross-platform determinism across all 32-bit and 64-bit platforms that implements the
IEEE 754-2008 standard strictly. This includes most modern processors as well as WASM targets.

Currently, the `enhanced-determinism` feature cannot be enabled at the same time as the `parallel` or
`simd-{stable,nightly}` features.
