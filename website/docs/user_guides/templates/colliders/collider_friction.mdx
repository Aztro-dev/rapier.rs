Friction is a force that opposes the relative tangential motion between two rigid-bodies with colliders in contact.
This force has a direction orthogonal to the contact normal and opposite to the relative rigid-body motion at
the contact point. Following the Coulomb friction model, the maximum magnitude of this force is the magnitude of the
force along the contact normal multiplied by a **friction coefficient**. A friction coefficient
of 0 implies no friction at all (completely sliding contact) and a coefficient greater or equal to 1 implies a
very strong friction. Values greater than 1 are allowed.

:::note
Rapier does not make any distinction between the static and dynamic friction coefficients currently.

Each collider has its own friction coefficient. This means that when two colliders are in contact, we need to apply a
rule that combines the friction  coefficients of these two colliders into a single coefficient that will be used for
the contact. This rule is described by the `CoefficientCombineRule` enum:
- <notjs>`CoefficientCombineRule::Average`</notjs><js>`CoefficientCombineRule.Average`</js>: the average of the two coefficients is used for the contact.
- <notjs>`CoefficientCombineRule::Min`</notjs><js>`CoefficientCombineRule.Min`</js>: the minimum among the two coefficients is used for the contact.
- <notjs>`CoefficientCombineRule::Multiply`</notjs><js>`CoefficientCombineRule.Multiply`</js>: the product of the two coefficients is used for the contact.
- <notjs>`CoefficientCombineRule::Max`</notjs><js>`CoefficientCombineRule.Max`</js>: the maximum among the two coefficients is used for the contact.

By default, the `Average` rule is used. Each collider can be given its own friction combine rule. When two colliders are in
contact, we need to select one of their combine rule. The following precedence is used: `Max > Multiply > Min > Average`.

For example if one collider with the `Multiply` friction combine rule is in contact with a collider with the `Average` friction
combine rule, then the `Multiply` rule will be applied for the friction coefficient of this contact (i.e. the coefficients
of both colliders will be multiplied to obtain the coefficient used by the contact).

:::info
The `CoefficientCombineRule` system exists to cover a wide variety of use-cases efficiently. If this is not flexible
enough, it is possible to get  full control over the selection of friction coefficients for each contact point using
[contact modification](advanced_collision_detection#contact-modification). For example, contact modification allows the
simulation of colliders with non-uniform friction coefficients.

The friction coefficient and friction combine rule can both be set when the collider is created or after its creation:

<rapier>

```rust
/* Set the friction coefficient and friction combine rule
  when the collider is created. */
let collider = ColliderBuilder::ball(0.5)
    .friction(0.7)
    .friction_combine_rule(CoefficientCombineRule::Min)
    .build();
```
```rust
/* Set the friction coefficient and friction combine rule
   after the collider creation. */
let collider = collider_set.get_mut(collider_handle).unwrap();
collider.set_friction(0.7);
collider.set_friction_combine_rule(CoefficientCombineRule::Min);
assert_eq!(collider.friction(), 0.7);
assert_eq!(collider.friction_combine_rule(), CoefficientCombineRule::Min);
```
