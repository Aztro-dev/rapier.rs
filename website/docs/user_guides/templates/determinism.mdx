By default, Rapier is **locally deterministic**, meaning that running the exact same simulation (with the **same initial
conditions**) twice with the same machine, using the same version of Rapier, and the same version of the Rust compiler,
will result in the exact same simulation results. However, doing this on two different computers may result in
completely different results.

:::note
Two simulations run with the **same initial conditions** if all the [simulation structures](simulation_structures) are
initialized with the same values, rigid-bodies/colliders/joints are constructed the same way, and they are added/removed
to sets (rigid-body sets, etc.) in the exact same order.
:::

It is possible to make Rapier **cross-platform deterministic**, meaning that running a simulation with two different
computers (including different OS and/or different processors) will result in the exact same results. In order to
achieve this, both computers must start the simulation with the **same initial conditions** as discussed above, and the
following additional conditions must be met:
- The `enhanced-determinism` feature of Rapier is enabled. Note that the `enhanced-determinism` feature cannot be
  enabled at the same time as the `simd-nightly`, `simd-stable`, and `parallel` features.
- The target platforms must strictly comply to the IEEE 754-2008 floating-points standard. This ensures that
  floating-point computations behave the same on all platforms. This include most modern mainstream processors
  as well as WASM targets.
- If some of the values used to initialized Rapier structures are computed using floating points functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.) other
  than addition/subtraction/multiplication/division, then you need to make sure the functions being used originate from
  the `ComplexField` or `RealField` traits from `nalgebra`. For example, do `ComplexField::sin(0.4)` (where `ComplexField` is imported
  by `use nalgebra::ComplexField`) instead of `0.4.sin()`:
  
```rust
// WRONG version:
// The following will not work cross-platform-deterministically because the values
// given to `ColliderBuilder::translation` won't be cross-platform deterministic.
let collider = ColliderBuilder::ball(0.5)
                   .translation(1.0.sqrt(), 2.0.sin(), 3.0.cos())
                   .build();

// CORRECT version:
// The following will work cross-platform-deterministically because we use the
// functions from nalgebra.
let collider = ColliderBuilder::ball(0.5)
                  .translation(ComplexField::sqrt(1.0), ComplexField::sin(2.0), ComplexField::cos(3.0))
                  .build();
```
