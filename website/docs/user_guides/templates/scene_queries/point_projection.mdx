Point projection will either project a point on the closest collider of the scene (`QueryPipeline::project_point`),
or will enumerate every collider containing given point (`QueryPipeline::intersections_with_point`).

The `solid`, `group` and `filter` arguments are used to control the way point-projection works: by ignoring the shape
interiors and/or ignoring some colliders. See their description on the [ray-casting](#ray-casting) section.
